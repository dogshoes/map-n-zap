Section 3: Questions about using Cye to vacuum 

3.0 How can Cye turn on a vacuum?

A corded vacuum must be turned on and off manually by the user, but the cordless vacuum attachment can be controlled through Map-N-Zap. 

3.1 How does Cye know where on the floor to vacuum?

Cye vacuums the floor according to vacuum paths that are created by dragging and dropping in Map-N-Zap. No complex calculations are required. 

3.2 When using Cye to control a vacuum, does the robot bump into furniture or do sensors detect obstacles before it hits them?

Since Cye does not have any on board sensors, it would bump into any furniture accidentally placed in its path and then would calculate a path around the obstacle. However, Cye's soft urethane bumper protects both the furniture and robot from damage should a collision occur. Ideally, the vacuum paths created by Map-N-Zap would account for any known obstacles on the floor plan to eliminate the chance of a collision in the first place.
