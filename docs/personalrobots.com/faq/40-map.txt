Section 7: Questions about Map 

7.0 What is the "Map" component of Map-N-Zap?

Map is the software interface used to control Cye. The main window of Map displays the floor plan of whatever area Cye is navigating.

7.1 Is there a DLL I can use to send commands to the robot and obtain sensor information from it?

Yes. It is an OCX. The entire command set to and from the robot is exposed from VB or VC++. Commands include everything from "set wheel A velocity to X," to "go to position X, Y on the floor".
