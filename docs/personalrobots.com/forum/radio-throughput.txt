	Right. Hi. So i don't own a Cye (yet!), and i'm sure that the answer to my question is floating around here somewhere, but i couldn't find it. What's the radio throughput (bits per sec.) for cye-sr?
	
	I must say, Cye looks madly impressive. As soon as i have enough disposible cash laying around, i WILL have one. oh, sweet baby jesus yes. *droooooool*

	HENRY> The baud rate is 19,200 bps half duplex and there is a switching dead time taking approximately 30% of the line so it's 70% of 9600 =~ 6800 bps.

	PS There are 12 packets sent each way per second. I had three robots running off one PC yesterday and the degradation wasn't bad at all, I could still drag any robot around with complete control.
