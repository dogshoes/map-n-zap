	I have an older Cye that has the cat3 (phone line) to DB-9 adapter from the antenna pod. Two of the sockets on the DB-9 connector pulled out. Can anyone tell me what the proper pin out is for that connector? It has three leads; black, yellow, and green.

	Thanks,
	Troy

	Troy,

	Hello. Yellow is pin#2, Green is pin#3, & Black is pin#5.  Yellow is receive. Green is transmit and black is ground.

	Good luck.
