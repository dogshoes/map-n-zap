## CyeSrv.exe

This project compiles Map-N-Zap.exe, the program which is responsible for controlling the Cye robot.

### Compiling

Simply compile all projects in RobotWorld.sln and execute the resulting Map-N-Zap.exe generated by this project.  Before that it's necessary to register [richtx32.ocx in the vendor folder](../vendor), [CyeCom.ocx](../RRRCom), and [CyeSvr.exe](../RRRSrv).
